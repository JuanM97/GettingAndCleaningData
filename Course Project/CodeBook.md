Script Algorithm
* Read train and test files, including the data, the labels and the subjects for each experiment
* Merge corresponding data from each file
* Read the features to get te description of each measurement
* Get indexes that corresponds to mean or std from the merged data
* Read the names of the measured activities
* Label the merged data with the proper names from the features file
* Output the first file - tiDyData.txt

* Sort the Subject ids [1,30] ad activity names[laying, sitting, standing, walking, walking downstairs, walking upstairs], getting rid of repetitions
* Get a subset of the original data for each subject within each activity and add the mean to a new matrix
* Rename the columns properly
* Output the second file - tidyData-Means.txt
